# This document contains the project files for the paper "Best Initialization Vectors: Image Dimensionality Reduction and Linear Feature Analysis". The paper introduces a novel dimensionality reduction method that converts matrix-form data into vectors, outperforming several mainstream methods in terms of processing speed and feature retention capability. The primary goal is to establish a bridge between NLP and CV tasks.

# The "model" folder contains all the models required for the experiments, and the "dataset" folder stores the initially preprocessed data. Additional test data must be generated using the provided code. The "data_pre1" folder contains all the project files, where you can find the methods for generating all the required data, but the file organization is quite chaotic. The "data_pre2" folder offers a clearer outline of the code logic, with the code sequence being well-organized. However, users will need to adjust the variables as needed during use.

# Regarding version compatibility, we conducted tests on multiple computers, and the method works in a general environment. If you encounter version issues, consider switching to Python 3.9 and using Torch 2.5.0+cu121.
